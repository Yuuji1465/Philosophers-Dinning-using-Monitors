# Philosophers-Dinning-using-Monitors
- This is problem about 5 philosopher decide to have a dinner but there a big problem there only 5 chopsticks.
- They need to use 2 to grab the food so we have to manage to decide who can eat and who have to wait.
- This is our solution by using Monitors to manage that no pilosophers will be starve.
- We vizualize this program with SDL 2.0.
- Note: Extract the SDL.rar for the librabry we use to do the graphic, you don't need to set up anything but do the Extract.
