# Philosophers-Dinning-using-Monitors
This is problem about 5 philosopher decide to have a dinner but there a big problem there only 5 chopsticks
They need to use 2 to grab the food so we have to manage to decide who can eat and who have to wait
This is our solution by using Monitors to manage that no pilosophers wil be starve
We vizualize this program with SDL 2.0
